                        Rich Mullins was a Christian singer-songwriter who&rsquo;s music and legacy of compassion continues to be influential today. Always uncomfortable in the spotlight, Rich allowed his music to gain worldwide popularity while he retreated from fame, took
                        a vow of poverty, and dedicated the last years of his life to bringing music and the arts to native American children. He was known for the complexity in his music, using unconventional instrumentation and deeply descriptive and
                        metaphorical lyrics. His concerts and writings were filled with his own flavored wisdom, spun from his studies of the Bible and his observations of Christian life.
